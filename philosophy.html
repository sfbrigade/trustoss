    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>Open source is designed to build trust</h4>
    <p>On a number of different levels, we can see this principle in action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On a <strong>source code level</strong>, releaseing the source itself builds trust with your adoptors that the code won't cause any issues, as they can personally audit its functionality</li>
      <li>On a <strong>licencing level</strong>, an open source license builds trust that your adoptors won't be brought into costly litigations for copying (and/or possibly redistributing) your code.</li>
      <li>On a <strong>documentation level</strong>, the ideal open source project establishes trust that the application or library can be installed, how/where adoptors may contribute back to the project, and how the project may be governed.</li>
      <li>On a <strong>versioning level</strong>, making sure there is a proper git tag and release log for every release builds trust with your adoptors that upgrading the software won't cause their system to begin melting before their eyes. It lets them know how and when to migrate their systems (if needed) and who to credit for the features they like.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Open Source projects are diverse</h4>
    <p>Projects that have been released into the open source ecosystem are widely diverse. They range from utilities to full-blown applications, from small blogs to massive SaaS products. Even the languages they're built in differ so widely from each other that creating a unifying standard for project architecture can appear to be an unsurmountable task, even on the smallest of projects. While TrustOSS is not designed to solve this entire problem, it does try to tackle to one portion of it that seems to be the same across the board: <em>documentation</em>.</p>
